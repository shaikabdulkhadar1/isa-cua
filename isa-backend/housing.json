The best course of action, then, if you are interested in any particular property, is to give them a call to inquire further. Please be aware that in every situation, you will additionally require around $200 for extra start-up costs. This is because of the apartments being unfurnished, meaning you will need to purchase certain necessities for the space. The apartments include a gas range, refrigerator, dishwasher, air conditioning/heating, and hot water; some also have a washer-dryer."
